### Project Overview
The Water Billing System project leverages an Arduino water meter and IoT technology to measure water consumption and generate accurate billing data. The system is designed to provide real-time monitoring and automated billing, making water management more efficient and transparent for both providers and consumers.

### Features
-   **Real-Time Water Monitoring:** Continuously monitors water usage using an Arduino water meter.
-   **Automated Billing:** Generates accurate water bills based on real-time consumption data.
-   **IoT Integration:** Sends water usage data to a central server for processing and storage.
-   **User Interface:** Provides a web-based interface for users to view their water consumption and billing details.
-   **Alerts and Notifications:** Sends alerts for unusual water usage patterns and monthly billing reminders.

### Hardware Requirements
To set up the Water Billing System, you will need the following hardware components:
-   Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
-   Water flow sensor
-   Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266)
-   Jumper wires
-   Breadboard
-   Power supply
-   Housing for the water meter
